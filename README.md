# Recipe_Book
## Searching
    Create a recipe application that functions as a cook book and reference book. It will allow searching 
    to find recipes that fit specified criteria. Searching can be done through ingredients, proportions, 
    meal type, and meal plans.

## Recipe Pages
    It will have pages for each recipe with sections for pictures, ingredients, process, and notes. 
    Ingredients section will allow for sizing up and down recipes by ingredients and propotions. A cooking 
    mode will emphasize the process with relavent ingredient amounts next to each step. An edit button will 
    open all of the sections to editting. A delete button will allow deleting of page with a wall asking if 
    user is sure they want to delete.
    
## Meal Plans
    Meal plans create collections of 2-7 meals based on minimalized food waste. Minimalized food waste will
    use groups of produce and goods in sizes typically found in grocery stores. Meal plans will additionally
    include functionality based on the current kitchen stock. When a plan is selected it should show more 
    details for each meal, potentially a thin version of the full recipe. There will be a button to return
    to the previous page and select a different plan, or select the current plan. When the plan is selected
    it should be applied to the shopping list tab.
    
## Shopping List
    The shopping list should show all ingredients needed for the current meal plan. Items that are logged 
    into the current kitchen stock will note next to the item that it is already in the kitchen. An 
    unchecked box next to each item will allow the user to check off items they have, which will appear at 
    the bottom of each list unless the setting that allows them to fully disappear is checked. The list will 
    be sectioned into areas found in grocery stores.
    
## Current Kitchen Stock
    The current kitchen stock tab will log owned staples to improve meal plans and streamline forming a 
    shopping list. Anything will be able to be logged, but the focus will be on staples that are not used up 
    frequently.
    
    
# Goals within CS 211 Final Project scope
    I will be using WinForms to do this within the scope of the final project. Current goals for the project
    are subject to change, they are currently as follows:
    
    1. Create a class of recipes and sort them through a search of their properties.
    2. Have a button that allows creation of new recipes.
    3. Figure out a format for storing the recipes while the application is not running.
    4. Recipe ingredients should have two ingredient parameters, the name of the ingredient, and the amount
            in the standard recipe.
